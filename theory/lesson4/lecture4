# Lecture 4 
Operators are symbols that perform operations used for modifying or manipulating data. Manipulating data is an essential part of any programming language, and Dart is no different, providing a rich set of operators for its basic types.

## Types of operators
In this chapter, we are going to cover the following built-in operators in Dart:

1. Arithmetic Operators
2. Equality and Relational Operators
3. Type Test Operators
4. Assignment Operators
5. Logical Operators
6. Bitwise and Shift Operators


# Homework 3 for lectures 4
## Task 1
### Problems need to practice 
Go through problems and run all the variables. 
1. Retype them in your editor in practice1.dart
2. Retype them in your editor in lecture3demo2.dart

## Task 2
### Problems need to practice 
You are given a variable, fahrenheit, which stores a temperature in degrees Fahrenheit. You have to create a variable, celsius, which converts the temperature stored in fahrenheit to degrees Celsius.

To convert temperature from degrees Fahrenheit to degrees Celsius, you first need to subtract 32 from the temperature, then multiply it by 5, followed by a division by 9.

### Input
The input is the variable fahrenheit. Fahrenheit has already been declared for you.

### Output
The output will be the value assigned to celsius.

### Solution is given in practice3.dart
